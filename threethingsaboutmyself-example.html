Hi, i am User#0001.<br><br>

Over the time i have been on Discord, i have taken up several staff positions, such as moderator and administrator roles.<br>
I am also a good programmer and know how to code in several languages such as Javascript and Python. <br>
I am also very active on Discord and i enjoy helping others, and i can do various things depending on what i need to do. <br><br>

Some of the things i have learnt while being on Discord include how to be determined and patient while dealing with uncooperative users, and to be happy and optimistic no matter what happens, and to do my job to the best of my abilities.<br><br>
I have coded several things, such as my own website, and my own Discord Bot! The bot is called “helper“ and i enjoy maintaining it! I also own the support server for the bot, and i have built an awesome community!!!<br><br>
I have helped out in Epic Guild, such ad teaching new ERPG players how to play the game, or helping out in the questions channel. <br><br>

I hope you will consider me for the Mod position.
